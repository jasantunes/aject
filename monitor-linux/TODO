NON-ACTIVE WAIT

TimeTrace (PAPI/glibtop) does not take into account sleep/lock time.
It only measures useful CPU clocks/time.
 - glibtop: Other time fields (utime and stime) also suffer from this behavior.
 -    papi: only user space cycles are accounted

Selected Solution: creation of a wtime measured by gettimeofday difference
                   between last and start.


ACCURATE DISK USAGE

DiskTrace does not account for the previous size in fopen(w) calls, i.e., when
an existing file is open and truncated it reports 0 size. This behavior makes
DiskTrace disregard the deletion of the file contents.

Solution 1: intercept the file name and stat it for its size before the open
            syscall exit.

Solution 2: perform a fopen(r)/fclose()...
