# AJECT

AJECT is a PoC tool that implements the Network Attack Injection methodology.

The goal of this project was to study and analyze software vulnerabilities and to develop methodologies and tools to allow the automatic detection of potential software problems. The project culminated in the development of a first version of a blackbox testing tool with the same name that generates and injects network attacks to automatically discover security vulnerabilities in network servers. The work developed in this project was the main contribution of my MSc and the precursor of my doctoral work.
